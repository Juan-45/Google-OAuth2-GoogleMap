# Working google OAuth 2.0 for Client-side Web Applications authentication code. 

Created using React.js & Google APIs client library for JavaScript (Gapi). 

- Add an *.env* file in your app's root folder with the *Client_key & API_key* to be able to work with OAuth authorization.
  You can obtain these from Google Cloud Platform.
- To do requests to Google APIs, just remember to modify the SCOPES & DISCOVERY_DOCS values with the appropriate ones.
